## What did and did not work
I had difficulty with some padding and margin issues that were fixed by trial and error, particularly with the mobile version.
The opacity of the photos was interesting to figure out, but I did (I also was trying to do opacity: 50%; which didn't work)
Overall, I enjoyed the process and am proud of what I did.
